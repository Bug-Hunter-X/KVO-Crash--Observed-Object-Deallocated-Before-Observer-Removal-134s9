# Objective-C KVO Crash: Observed Object Deallocated Before Observer Removal

This repository demonstrates a common error in Objective-C when using Key-Value Observing (KVO). The bug occurs when the observed object is deallocated before the observer removes itself, causing a crash.

## Bug Description
The `KVODeallocCrash.m` file contains code that registers a KVO observer. However, it fails to remove the observer before the observed object is deallocated. This leads to a crash when the deallocated object is accessed by the observer.

## Solution
The `KVODeallocCrashSolution.m` file provides the solution.  This involves ensuring that the observer is removed using `removeObserver:forKeyPath:` before the observed object is deallocated.  Proper cleanup in `dealloc` methods is essential.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the original `KVODeallocCrash.m` code; observe the crash.
4. Run the corrected `KVODeallocCrashSolution.m` code; observe that the crash is resolved.

## Additional Notes
Always remember to remove KVO observers in the appropriate lifecycle methods (e.g., `dealloc`, `viewDidDisappear`, etc.) to prevent these types of crashes.  Using `@weakify` and `@strongify` macros with blocks can help with managing retain cycles in KVO, further reducing this type of problem.
